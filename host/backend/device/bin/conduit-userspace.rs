//! Stage the host's NVIDIA user-mode driver for a guest to mount.
//!
//! A guest image must not carry its own copy of the driver userspace: the
//! ioctls this project forwards are a private contract between one build of
//! `libcuda` and one build of the host kernel module, so the only way for the
//! two to be in step is for them to be the same files. This walks the driver's
//! own manifest, finds what a guest needs on this host, and builds a directory
//! to export read-only over a filesystem share.
//!
//!     conduit-userspace                      # what this host would export
//!     conduit-userspace --stage /run/nvgpu   # build the share
//!
//! The staged tree is hard links where the filesystem allows it, so exporting
//! ~1 GiB of driver costs no extra space and no copy. It falls back to symlinks
//! across filesystems, which a share can still follow because the target is
//! resolved on the host side.
