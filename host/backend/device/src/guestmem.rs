//! Guest RAM, as the backend can reach it, and how a guest's pages become one
//! host address.
//!
//! RM registers memory by a CPU address: it takes an address and a length and
//! pins what is there. The guest's address means nothing in this process, so
//! the guest sends the *physical* pages behind it instead -- pinned on its
//! side so they cannot move -- and the backend builds an address of its own
//! that aliases exactly those pages and nothing else.
//!
//! That is possible because a vhost-user frontend hands the backend each guest
//! RAM region as a file descriptor, not merely as a mapping: `vhost-user-backend`
//! builds every region with `MmapRegion::from_file`, so the fd and the offset
//! within it are still there to be read. The backend reserves a span of its own
//! address space and maps each run into it from that fd at the matching offset.
//! The result is contiguous for RM and is the guest's own memory page for page.
//!
//! Everything that could make it *not* exactly the guest's memory is checked
//! here, because this is the only place that knows both halves:
//!
//! - every run lies wholly inside one region of guest RAM, so a run cannot
//!   reach past the end of a region into whatever the backend has mapped next;
//! - the runs add up to exactly the length being registered, so RM cannot pin
//!   a byte the guest did not send;
//! - runs and lengths are page-aligned, because a partial page cannot be
//!   mapped and rounding one up would hand RM a neighbour.
//!
//! A failure leaves nothing mapped: the reservation is dropped as a unit.
