//! Memory named by a CPU address, on the three routes that allow it.
//!
//! RM takes an address and a length and pins what is there for the GPU. The
//! address is read in the caller's address space, and the caller is this
//! backend: a guest that writes an address of its own has RM pin whatever of
//! *this* process's memory sits at that number. Nothing about the call says
//! it came from a guest, so nothing about RM's answer would look wrong.
//!
//! So the address is translated. The guest pins the pages behind it and sends
//! where they are; this file stitches them into one host span that aliases
//! exactly those pages ([`crate::guestmem`]), writes that span's address into
//! the parameter block in place of the guest's, and forwards the call. The
//! offsets of the address, the limit and the descriptor type are read from the
//! host release by [`abi::osdesc`] rather than written down here.
//!
//! The span lives as long as RM's object does, because RM pinned those pages
//! for that object's life and unmapping them earlier would leave RM pointing
//! at nothing. It is released when the object is freed, when the client that
//! holds it is freed, and on the file's close -- the same three moments the
//! guest driver releases its own pin.
//!
//! When the translation cannot be made -- no memory table from the transport,
//! no page runs from the guest, or runs that do not describe what was asked
//! for -- the call is refused rather than forwarded. The refusal goes back as
//! RM's own status in the parameter block and not as an ioctl errno, for the
//! reason the rest of the backend does the same: an errno makes NVIDIA's
//! userspace retry or hang, and a status is an answer it already knows how to
//! read. `NV_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is what RM itself writes for a heap function
//! it does not serve.
