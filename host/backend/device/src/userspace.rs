//! Which host files a guest needs in order to drive the forwarded GPU.
//!
//! The guest runs NVIDIA's real user-mode libraries, and those libraries must
//! be the *same build* as the host kernel driver they end up talking to: the
//! ioctls this crate forwards are a private contract between one version of
//! `libcuda` and one version of `nvidia.ko`. Shipping a guest image with its
//! own copy of the driver userspace makes that a coincidence to be maintained,
//! and it breaks the first time a host is updated.
//!
//! So the guest gets the host's copy. This module works out which files that
//! is; a read-only filesystem share carries them across. Nothing is
//! redistributed and the versions cannot drift, because they are the same
//! bytes.
//!
//! The approach is the one container runtimes already use for GPUs -- a
//! container image never contains a driver either -- applied to a VM, where a
//! filesystem share replaces the bind mount.
//!
//! # Where the list comes from
//!
//! Recent drivers ship their own manifest at
//! `/usr/share/nvidia/files.d/sandboxutils-filelist.json`, which is
//! authoritative and versioned with the driver that installed it. Parsing that
//! is strongly preferred to globbing `/usr/lib` for `libnvidia-*`: it
//! distinguishes a library the guest needs from one only the host does, and it
//! says which capability each file serves.
//!
//! # The manifest is not always the loaded driver
//!
//! "versioned with the driver that installed it" is true of the manifest and
//! says nothing about which driver is *running*. A host can carry two driver
//! userspaces at once -- distribution packages for one version and a `.run`
//! installer or a Flatpak runtime for another -- and then the manifest
//! describes whichever install wrote it last, while `libcuda.so.1` points at
//! the other and `nvidia.ko` is the other again.
//!
//! Staging the wrong one is the worst failure this module has, because it does
//! not look like one: the share builds, the guest mounts it, every forwarded
//! ioctl returns 0, and the caller gives up somewhere deep in a driver whose
//! userspace is a different build from the kernel module it is talking to. So
//! [`loaded_driver_version`] reads the version of the module actually loaded
//! and callers compare it against [`staged_driver_version`] before writing a
//! share. Measured on a host with 595.91.07 packages and a 595.99.02 module
//! loaded, where the stager silently picked the packages.
//!
//! # What is deliberately left out
//!
//! Not every entry belongs in a guest, and two kinds actively should not go:
//!
//! - **Firmware** (`gsp_*.bin`, `ucodes_*.bin`) is loaded by the *host* kernel
//!   module onto the GPU. A guest has no GPU to load it onto and no kernel
//!   module to do the loading.
//! - **`nvidia-modprobe`** exists to create `/dev/nvidia*` by loading the real
//!   kernel module. In a guest those nodes are ours, and a setuid helper that
//!   tries to modprobe a driver that is not there can only fail confusingly.
//!
//! Both are filtered by [`Capability`] rather than by name, so a driver that
//! adds a new firmware file does not need a change here.
