//! A guest's video memory, counted and held to `--vram-limit-mib`.
//!
//! Every RM call a guest makes is the backend's on the host, so RM sees one
//! process per guest with the whole card to allocate from. Nothing between
//! the guest and the card bounds what it may take, and video memory cannot be
//! reclaimed from a guest that holds it: one guest can leave every other on
//! the card, and the host's own desktop, with nothing.
//!
//! This is the bookkeeping, and only that. It knows nothing of RM's classes
//! or parameter blocks: the RM path says what was allocated, under which
//! parent, and how many bytes of video memory it holds, and asks here whether
//! an allocation fits. Refusing one is the RM path's job, and it refuses the
//! way RM refuses an allocation it cannot back -- `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` in the
//! caller's block, the ioctl itself succeeding -- so a guest over its limit
//! fails exactly as a guest on a full card does. That is the same choice the
//! DRM native-context path made in conduit-vmm (`virtio-devices/src/gpu/vram.rs`):
//! no failure mode the guest's driver has not already met.
//!
//! # What a charge lives as long as
//!
//! RM frees an object together with everything allocated under it, and a
//! client together with everything in it. So every object the guest makes is
//! recorded with its parent, whether it holds memory or not: freeing a device
//! has to release the memory allocated under its subdevice, and that cannot be
//! found from the memory object alone. A duplicate (`RM_DUP_OBJECT`) is the
//! same memory under a second handle, charged once and released with the
//! last handle that holds it.
//!
//! # Admitted by what was asked, charged by what RM took
//!
//! RM rounds an allocation up to its page size and says so in the reply. The
//! request is admitted against the size asked for, before the host sees it;
//! the charge is the size RM reports after. The limit can therefore be passed
//! by at most one allocation's rounding, and is never passed by more.
//!
//! # Without a limit
//!
//! Everything is still counted, so a teardown line can say what a workload
//! peaked at: the number a limit has to be chosen from.
