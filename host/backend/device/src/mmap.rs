//! Active guest mappings.
//!
//! One entry per live `NV_ESC_RM_MAP_MEMORY`, keyed by the SHM offset that was
//! written back into `pLinearAddress`. The guest library stores that value and
//! echoes it in `NV_ESC_RM_UNMAP_MEMORY`, which gives an unambiguous lookup key
//! without handing the guest a host address.
//!
//! The entry owns the `ShmRegion`, because releasing a mapping means two things
//! that must not come apart: restoring the SHM backing, and returning the
//! extent to its zone. Doing only the first is what made the allocator leak.
