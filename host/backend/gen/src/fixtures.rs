//! Checking generated tables against a real driver.
//!
//! `gen/fixtures/*.tsv` records the ioctl parameter sizes actually observed on
//! hardware, captured with `nvidia_sniffer` under `LD_PRELOAD`. The tables in
//! `versions/` are derived from gVisor's nvproxy; the fixtures are derived from
//! a running GPU. Neither is checked against the other anywhere else, so a
//! disagreement here means one of them is wrong about a driver we claim to
//! support -- which is exactly the failure that is otherwise found only at
//! runtime, in a guest, as a silently truncated ioctl.
//!
//! Two captures, chosen to disagree if anything is version- or
//! architecture-specific:
//!
//! | fixture | driver | GPU | profile it resolves to |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `580.178.04.tsv` | 580.178.04 | Tesla T4 (Turing) | its own |
//! | `615.71.09.tsv` | 615.71.09 | RTX A2000 (Ampere) | 595.71.05, by range |
//!
//! The second is the one that earns its keep. 615.71.09 has no profile of its
//! own, so it exercises the range selection that the whole versioning scheme
//! rests on: if picking the highest profile `<=` the driver version were
//! wrong, this is where it would show.
