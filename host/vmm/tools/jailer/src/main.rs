//! jailer -- runs one nesbox box inside a jail.
//!
//! This is nesbox's jailer, not a general-purpose one, and the difference is
//! the point. It takes the box's own config file, works out from it which
//! host paths that box will need, brings exactly those in, and execs nesbox
//! with the same config. There is no `-- <command>` to hand it: the program
//! it starts is nesbox, and knowing that is what lets it do the work a
//! caller would otherwise have to do by hand and keep in step by hand.
//! Firecracker's jailer is the model -- `--exec-file`, and a jail set up for
//! the one program it knows it is starting.
//!
//! nesbox cannot do any of this to itself. `chroot`, `mount` and `setuid` are
//! all on its own seccomp denylist (`vmm/src/seccomp.rs`,
//! `nothing_that_reconfigures_the_host_is_allowed_anywhere`), and an
//! unprivileged process cannot change its own uid regardless of what its
//! filter permits. So this is a separate binary, run before nesbox exists,
//! that does six things and then is gone:
//!
//!   1. read the box config, and derive every host path that box needs.
//!   2. unshare a mount namespace, and cut propagation to the host's, so
//!      nothing done here leaks back out.
//!   3. build the jail: the image, read-only, as the lower half of an
//!      overlay whose upper half is a `tmpfs` private to this box. See
//!      [`build_jail`] -- the image is never written to, by this or by
//!      anything running inside it.
//!   4. bind-mount those paths, at the same path inside the jail.
//!   5. `chroot` into the merged tree. The image itself was built and
//!      materialized elsewhere; this binary does not build, fetch or
//!      version it.
//!   6. drop from root to the uid/gid the caller names.
//!   7. `execve` nesbox, with the same config file.
//!
//! # The config decides what comes in
//!
//! `docs/SECURITY.md` considered a jailer once and rejected it because "the
//! DRM render node, virtiofs source directories, and the metrics socket path
//! all live outside any plausible jail." That is true of a jail built to
//! *exclude* the host; it is not true of one built to *include* exactly what
//! is needed. And the list is neither guesswork nor a pile of flags the
//! caller has to keep in step with the config -- it is read out of it:
//!
//!   * `boot-source.kernel_image_path`     the kernel nesbox loads
//!   * `drives[].path_on_host`             every disk image
//!   * `gpu.render-node`                   the DRM render node
//!   * `gpu-forward.socket`                the forwarding backend's socket
//!   * `gpu-forward.proc-nvidia`           only if it is outside /proc
//!   * `network`, if present               /dev/net/tun and /dev/vhost-net
//!   * `vsock`, if present                 /dev/vhost-vsock
//!   * `stats-socket`, if present          the directory it is created in
//!   * `shared-directories[].path-on-host` each virtiofs source
//!
//! plus `/dev/kvm`, `/proc` and `/sys`, which every box needs, and the config
//! file itself. [`Args::bind`] is the escape hatch for anything a config does
//! not name; needing it routinely means something belongs in the list above.
//!
//! Every path has to be absolute, and this refuses a config that gives a
//! relative one. nesbox opens them *after* this binary has chrooted and
//! `chdir`ed to `/`, so a relative path would resolve against a directory
//! that no longer exists -- better a refusal here, naming the field, than a
//! confusing ENOENT out of nesbox later.
//!
//! virtiofsd is the one thing nesbox opens that is deliberately *not* bound
//! in: nesbox spawns it, so the binary has to exist inside the jail, and the
//! jail image ships it (`build/Dockerfile`). Only the directories it serves
//! come from the host. It still runs `--sandbox none`, unsandboxed, exactly
//! as `docs/SECURITY.md` already records.
//!
//! # What this does not claim
//!
//! `/proc` and `/sys` are bound in from the host, not fresh instances of
//! their own -- cgroup self-reporting (`vmm/src/isolation.rs`) reads real
//! ancestor cgroups, which only exist on the host's tree. That makes the
//! host's process list and sysfs tree reachable inside the jail as read
//! paths. The mount namespace stops the jailed process from seeing other
//! mount points; it does not give it a private `/proc`. This is not
//! PID-namespace isolation, and does not claim to be.
//!
//! That has a sharper consequence than "reduced isolation" if the caller
//! ever hands this a uid already in use elsewhere on the host: a process
//! reading `/proc/<pid>/root` for a same-uid `pid` can reach that process's
//! filesystem view, unconfined by this jail, subject to the kernel's own
//! ptrace-read permission check (dumpable flag, Yama's `ptrace_scope`).
//! [`refuse_if_uid_is_live`] refuses to proceed if a live host process
//! already holds the target uid at the moment this runs -- a sanity check
//! against misconfiguration, not a guarantee against one starting a moment
//! later. Collision-free uid allocation across the whole host is the
//! caller's contract to keep, not something enforceable from in here.
//!
//! Nothing here applies a cgroup. That stays the supervisor's job, exactly
//! as before -- see `docs/SECURITY.md`, "Why not Firecracker's jailer".

  jailer --config <box.json> --jail-root <path> --uid <uid> --gid <gid> [options]

Runs nesbox inside a jail. Reads <box.json> to work out which host paths that
box needs -- its kernel, its disk images, its render node or GPU forwarding
socket, its tap and vhost devices, its virtiofs sources, its metrics
directory -- bind-mounts them into <jail-root> at the same path, chroots,
drops from root to <uid>:<gid>, and execs nesbox with the same config.

Must run as root -- that is the whole point: it does the things nesbox's own
seccomp filter refuses to let nesbox do to itself. Nothing it does stays
privileged past the drop.

The jail image is never written to: it is the read-only lower half of an
overlay whose upper half is a tmpfs private to this box, so mount points and
anything the box writes go there and vanish when it exits.

Options:
  --nesbox-bin <path>   nesbox inside the jail image. Default /usr/bin/nesbox.
  --bind <path>          an extra host path to bring in, at the same path
                         inside the jail; repeatable. An escape hatch for
                         something a config does not name -- everything a
                         config does name comes in without being asked for.
  --scratch-dir <path>   where the overlay's writable layer goes.
                         Default /run/nesbox-jailer.
  --dry-run              print the paths this config would bring in, and why,
                         then exit. Needs no root and mounts nothing.

Every path in the config must be absolute: this chroots before nesbox opens
any of them, so a relative path would resolve against a directory that is no
longer there. /dev/kvm, /proc and /sys always come in. /proc and /sys are the
host's own, read-write -- see the module doc comment for what that does and
does not mean.";
