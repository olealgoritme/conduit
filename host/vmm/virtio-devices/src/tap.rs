//! A tap interface, the host end of the guest's network link.
//!
//! Taps are *opened*, never created. A tap the host set up beforehand and gave
//! to the user nesbox runs as can be attached to with no privilege at all --
//! the kernel demands `CAP_NET_ADMIN` only to create a device, or when the
//! opener is not its owner (`tun_not_capable` in `drivers/net/tun.c`). Creating
//! them here would mean shipping a VMM that wants net-admin on its binary,
//! which is a thing to ask of everyone who self-hosts.
//!
//! `scripts/nestri-net-setup.sh` creates them. The interface is not persistent: it
//! exists only while we hold the file descriptor, so it disappears when the VM
//! exits however the VM exits, including a crash. Nothing has to clean up
//! after us.
//!
//! What is *not* here, and cannot be: routing the tap's subnet to the outside
//! world. That is `ip_forward` plus a NAT rule, which is host-global state and
//! belongs to whoever installs nesbox, not to a running VM.
