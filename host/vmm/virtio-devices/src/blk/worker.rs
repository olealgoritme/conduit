//! One worker per virtqueue: drains the ring, keeps as many requests in flight
//! as the guest offers, and completes them out of order.
//!
//! The old device did the opposite of each of those. It served one request at a
//! time with `seek` + `read_exact`, so the file offset was shared state and
//! depth was structurally 1; and it read into a freshly allocated host buffer
//! and copied that into guest memory, which is already mapped in this process.
//! A guest submitting 128 deep got them executed in single file, with an
//! allocation and a copy each.
//!
//! Here a request's guest pages *are* the I/O buffer, and the only thing that
//! serialises requests is the disk.
