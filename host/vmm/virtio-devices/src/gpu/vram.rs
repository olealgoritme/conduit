// Per-VM VRAM accounting for the DRM native-context path.
//
// A guest on this path carries no vendor GPU driver. It allocates device memory
// by sending an `AMDGPU_CCMD_GEM_NEW` command through virtio-gpu, which the
// renderer turns into an `amdgpu_bo_alloc` on the host. Nothing between the
// guest and the card bounds how much it may ask for, so one guest can exhaust a
// card that other guests are sharing.
//
// This module counts those allocations and refuses the ones that would take a
// guest past its limit.
//
// # This module measures. It does not enforce.
//
// That split was forced by the protocol, and the reasoning is worth keeping
// because the wrong answer looks obviously right.
//
// The guest reaches device memory in two steps:
//
//   1. `SUBMIT_3D` carrying `AMDGPU_CCMD_GEM_NEW` — the renderer calls
//      `amdgpu_bo_alloc`. **This is where host memory is committed.**
//   2. `RESOURCE_CREATE_BLOB` naming the same `blob_id` — the renderer looks the
//      already-allocated buffer up and wraps it in a virtio resource.
//
// So step 2 is too late to refuse: the memory is already taken, and refusing
// leaves it allocated with no resource id to free it by. Step 1 looks right, and
// refusing it does prevent the allocation.
//
// But **neither step can report a refusal to the guest.** Both are asynchronous.
// The guest kernel does not wait for a response to either one, so a refused
// submit produces `*ERROR* response 0x1200` in the guest's log and nothing else:
// the ioctl already returned success, Mesa proceeds with a buffer it believes
// exists, and the first submit referencing it waits forever on a fence.
// Measured — the guest hangs instead of failing.
//
// The renderer has the one channel that can carry the news: `shmem->async_error`,
// which Mesa reads through `amdvgpu_cs_query_reset_state2` and reports as a lost
// context. So enforcement lives in the renderer, in the `GEM_NEW` handler, where
// a genuine `amdgpu_bo_alloc` failure is already handled — a guest over its
// budget then fails exactly as a guest on a full card does, and no new failure
// path is introduced into a driver we do not own. See
// `patches/0002-virglrenderer-amdgpu-per-guest-VRAM-budget.patch`.
//
// What is left here is worth keeping on its own: the VMM is the only place that
// sees every guest, so this is where per-guest occupancy becomes a number
// capacity planning can use. It is also a cross-check — if these totals and the
// renderer's disagree, one of them is wrong.
//
// # What counts
//
// Only allocations that ask for `AMDGPU_GEM_DOMAIN_VRAM`. GTT buffers live in
// host system memory, and double-counting them here would refuse guests for
// memory they are not taking from the card. GTT totals are tracked for
// observability and never enforced.
//
// That used to be justified by saying host memory "is bounded for the whole VMM
// process by cgroups". Nothing in this repository applies a cgroup, so the claim
// was only ever true if whoever launched the process remembered -- and nothing
// checked or said. `vmm/src/isolation.rs` now reports the limits actually in
// force at startup and warns when there is no `memory.max` above this process,
// which is exactly the case where GTT growth is bounded by nothing at all.
//
// # Trust
//
// Every field read here is guest-controlled. The parser bounds-checks each
// record and never panics. It reports a stream it cannot understand rather than
// guessing at it — but since nothing here gates the submit, a parse failure costs
// accuracy in the log, not safety.
