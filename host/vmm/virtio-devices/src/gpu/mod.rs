//! Virtio GPU over PCI, backed by rutabaga's DRM native context.
//!
//! Ported from the virtio-MMIO implementation on the old `main` branch. The
//! command handling, the rutabaga bridge and the protocol definitions came
//! across nearly unchanged; the transport did not.
//!
//! Unlike every other device here, the GPU cannot be handed to a vhost
//! backend: rutabaga lives in this process, so the queues are serviced by a
//! worker thread of our own.
