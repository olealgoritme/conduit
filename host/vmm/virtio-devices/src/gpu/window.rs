// The host-visible window: how much of a guest's GPU memory it may reach directly.
//
// A blob resource the guest wants to touch with the CPU is mapped into BAR2 and
// registered with KVM, so afterwards the guest reads and writes it without
// trapping to us at all. That is what makes it fast, and it is also why it needs
// a bound: every mapping costs host address space and a KVM memory slot, and
// nothing in the protocol makes a guest ask for a reasonable number of them.
//
// # This one can be refused properly
//
// Unlike a VRAM allocation (see `vram.rs`), `RESOURCE_MAP_BLOB` is
// **synchronous**: the guest kernel waits for `RESP_OK_MAP_INFO` because it needs
// the offset before userspace can mmap anything. So a refusal here reaches the
// guest as a failed mmap, which Mesa reports as a failed buffer map, which is an
// ordinary error an application already handles.
//
// That makes this the one GPU bound where the guest-visible failure and the host
// bound are the same event.
//
// # Two resources, two limits
//
// **Bytes** is the documented quota, because host address space is the thing a
// tier is sized against.
//
// **Mapping count** is bounded separately and defaults to unbounded. Each mapping
// is a KVM memory slot, and KVM has a few thousand; a guest that maps single
// pages could exhaust them. That already fails safely -- KVM refuses the slot and
// the map returns an error -- so the count is *reported* by default rather than
// capped, because no measurement yet says what a real workload needs and a cap
// guessed too low breaks it.
