//! What is actually confining this process, and the one thing it can do about it
//! by itself.
//!
//! seccomp bounds what a compromised device model may *call*. It does not bound
//! what it may *reach*: `openat` and `connect` are both on the policy, so the
//! process keeps its uid's whole filesystem and its network. Those are bounded
//! by things that live outside this program — a uid, a mount namespace, a
//! network namespace, a cgroup — and until now nesbox neither applied them nor
//! looked to see whether anyone else had.
//!
//! That gap had a specific cost. `virtio-devices/src/gpu/vram.rs` declines to
//! enforce a GTT limit on the grounds that "host system memory is bounded for the
//! whole VMM process by cgroups", and `docs/STATS.md` repeats it. Nothing in this
//! repository applies a cgroup. The claim was true only if whoever launched the
//! process remembered, and nothing checked, and nothing said.
//!
//! # Reporting, not assuming
//!
//! [`Report::gather`] answers "what is in effect right now" from `/proc` and
//! `/sys/fs/cgroup`, and [`Report::log`] says so at startup — including, loudly,
//! when a bound that other parts of this codebase assume is simply absent. A
//! supervisor that forgets a `MemoryMax=` now produces a line saying so on every
//! boot instead of a surprise at 3am.
//!
//! Reporting is the honest shape here rather than applying limits ourselves.
//! `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` §12 measured what cgroups do to a guest, and the answer
//! was that the supervisor is the right owner: a `cpu.max` holds, an `io.max`
//! holds only against cold host cache, and `memory.max` is not a bound on the
//! guest at all — it decides what happens when a guest exceeds the RAM it was
//! given, which on a host with swap is silent thrashing and on a host without is
//! an OOM kill of the VMM. Applying that from in here would put a second, worse
//! copy of a decision the supervisor already makes.
//!
//! # The one thing this can do unprivileged
//!
//! [`enter_network_namespace`] unshares a user namespace and a network namespace
//! together. That needs no privilege — the new user namespace grants
//! `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` over the network namespace created alongside it — and it takes
//! away every route out of this process while leaving the guest's own link
//! working, because the tap file descriptor was opened before the unshare and a
//! socket keeps the namespace it was created in.
//!
//! It is **off by default**, and the reasons are in `enter_network_namespace`.
//! Read them before turning it on: on a host whose render node is not
//! world-accessible it will stop the GPU from working.
